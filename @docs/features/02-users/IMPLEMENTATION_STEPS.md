# Users Feature Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each users task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

## Architecture Integration Points
- **UI Components**: Leverage existing components from `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/forms/`
- **API Client**: Use the established API client from `src/lib/api/axios.ts`
- **State Management**: 
  - Follow Zustand patterns in `src/store/slices/`
  - Use React Query for server state and caching
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling with descriptive messages
- **Route Protection**: Use auth middleware for protecting dashboard routes
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work on mobile, tablet and desktop
- **Testing**: Maintain minimum 80% test coverage following TDD approach
