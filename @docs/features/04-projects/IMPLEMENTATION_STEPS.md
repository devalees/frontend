# Projects Feature Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each projects task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

  - Follow Next.js app router conventions for nested routes
- **Performance**:
  - Implement lazy loading for project components
  - Use pagination for large project lists
  - Apply proper caching strategies for project data
- **Security**:
  - Enforce project-level permissions based on user roles
  - Validate operations against user permissions
  - Implement proper data access controls
- **Testing**:
