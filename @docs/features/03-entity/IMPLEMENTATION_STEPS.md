# Entity Feature Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each entity task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

  - Use React Query for server state, especially for relationship data
  - Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- **Validation**: 
  - Create reusable validation rules that can be composed
  - Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback
  - Connect with server-side validation through API services
- **Data Flow**:
  - Implement clear unidirectional data flow for entity operations
  - Use React Query for automatic cache invalidation on entity changes
- **Performance**:
  - Implement pagination and virtual scrolling for large entity lists
  - Use memoization for expensive entity operations
  - Implement lazy loading for entity relationship visualization
- **Testing**: 
  - Maintain minimum 80% test coverage following TDD approach
