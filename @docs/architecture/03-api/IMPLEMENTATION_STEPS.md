# API Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each API task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

       - [ ] Review and adjust

Status Indicators:
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Completed
- [!] Blocked/Issues

Last Updated: Implemented Response Handlers with support for parsing API responses, transforming data with type-safe transformers, and handling various error scenarios. The implementation handles standard responses, paginated data, custom data extraction, and various error types including network, timeout, and server errors. All tests are now passing. Next steps will focus on refactoring and optimization. (Date: August 2023)
