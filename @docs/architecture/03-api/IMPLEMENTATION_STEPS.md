# API Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each API task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **API Client Setup**
   - [x] Axios Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (axiosConfig.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for instance creation
       - [x] Write failing tests for base configuration
       - [x] Write failing tests for interceptors
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Create axios instance
       - [x] Configure base settings
       - [x] Set up interceptors

       - [x] Write failing tests for error logging
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Implement error types
