# API Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each API task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **API Client Setup**
   - [x] Axios Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (axiosConfig.test.ts)

     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Set up socket client
       - [x] Implement event handling

       - [ ] Review and adjust

Status Indicators:
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Completed
- [!] Blocked/Issues

Last Updated: Implemented Request Builders with support for creating API requests with various HTTP methods, parameter handling with URL encoding, and request validation for required parameters, types, and formats. All tests are now passing. Next steps will focus on refactoring and optimization. (Date: August 2023)
