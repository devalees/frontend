# API Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each API task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

- [!] Blocked/Issues

Last Updated: Successfully implemented and fixed Token Refresh Mechanism and Optimistic Updates system. All tests are now passing. The token refresh mechanism handles 401 responses to transparently refresh expired JWT tokens. The optimistic updates feature provides immediate UI updates while requests are in flight, with robust rollback handling for failed requests. Both implementations follow the project's TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage. (Date: August 2023)
