# Foundation Setup Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each setup task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Project Setup**
   - [ ] Project Structure
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (projectStructure.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for directory structure
       - [ ] Write failing tests for file naming
       - [ ] Write failing tests for module organization
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Create directory structure
       - [ ] Set up file naming conventions

       - [ ] Configure peer dependencies
       - [ ] Set up development dependencies
     - [ ] Refactoring

       - [ ] Update package.json
       - [ ] Review and adjust

       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Development Tools
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (devTools.test.ts)
