# Documentation Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each documentation task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Code Documentation**
   - [~] Comment Styles
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (commentStyles.test.ts)
