# Performance Optimization Implementation Steps

> **Note**: When writing tests for these performance features, please follow our standardized testing approach:

> - [Performance Testing Approach](./TESTING_APPROACH.md) - Performance-specific testing guidelines

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each performance task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

## Implementation Notes and Lessons Learned

### Route-based Splitting
- **Testing Performance Marks**: When testing performance marks in components, ensure marks and measures are created synchronously for test compatibility
- **Mock Performance API**: Use the mockPerformance utility for consistent testing of performance metrics
- **Async Handling**: When testing async operations (like preloading), use waitFor to ensure operations complete before assertions

### Component Splitting
- **Test-First Approach**: Created failing tests for component splitting before implementation
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Created tests to verify error boundary handling and retry functionality
- **Performance Tracking**: Added tests to verify performance marks for component loading and rendering
- **Mock Implementation**: Created a skeleton componentLoader module to make tests compile

### Browser Caching
- **Comprehensive Caching Strategy**: Implemented a robust browser caching system with support for max-age and stale-while-revalidate directives
- **Background Revalidation**: Added background refresh for stale-but-usable cached data to improve user experience
- **Cache Invalidation Patterns**: Implemented various cache invalidation strategies (manual, pattern-based, expiration-based)
- **Debugging Challenges**: Resolved issues with cache expiration detection and pattern matching for cache keys
- **Performance Tracking**: Added extensive performance marks to track cache hits, misses, and updates for monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- **Test-first Approach**: Creating failing tests first helped identify the correct implementation pattern
- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: For component testing, performance marks must be created synchronously for tests to verify them
- **Centralized Testing Utilities**: Using the mockPerformance utility ensures consistent behavior across all performance tests

Status Indicators:
