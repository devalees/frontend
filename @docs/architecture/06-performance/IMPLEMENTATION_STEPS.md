# Performance Optimization Implementation Steps

> **Note**: When writing tests for these performance features, please follow our standardized testing approach:

> - [Performance Testing Approach](./TESTING_APPROACH.md) - Performance-specific testing guidelines

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each performance task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Code Splitting**
   - [ ] Route-based Splitting
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (routeSplitting.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for route loading

       - [ ] Write failing tests for preloading
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Implement route splitting
       - [ ] Configure chunk loading
       - [ ] Set up preloading
     - [ ] Refactoring

       - [ ] Optimize caching
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Service Worker
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (serviceWorker.test.ts)
