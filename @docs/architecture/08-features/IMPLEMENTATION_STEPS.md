# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Completed Documentation Setup with passing tests for documentation structure, content validation, and format checking. The implementation follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with Red (failing tests), Green (passing implementation), and optimized code. All tests use the centralized testing utilities and maintain >90% code coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines. The documentation setup module provides validation for documentation structure, content requirements, and formatting rules including code block validation and heading level restrictions. This completes the first part of the Feature Documentation section, with Documentation Implementation as the next step.
