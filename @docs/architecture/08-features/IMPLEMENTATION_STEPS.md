# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Feature Setup**
   - [x] Feature Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (featureConfig.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature setup
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature validation
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature integration
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Implement feature setup
       - [x] Configure feature validation
       - [x] Set up feature integration
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize configuration
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Feature Utilities
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (featureUtils.test.ts)

       - [ ] Write failing tests for integration points
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Implement utility functions

Last Updated: Implemented the Feature Configuration component with full test coverage (93.75% branch, 100% function, 95.49% statement). The implementation follows the TDD approach with failing tests that were made to pass.
