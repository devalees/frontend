# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Feature Setup**
   - [x] Feature Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (featureConfig.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature setup
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature validation
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature integration
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Implement feature setup
       - [x] Configure feature validation
       - [x] Set up feature integration
     - [ ] Refactoring

       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [x] Feature Utilities

Last Updated: Completed Documentation Implementation with passing tests for feature documentation, usage guides, and examples. All tests are now passing, validating the functionality of the Documentation Implementation module. The documentation generation follows the test-driven development approach and includes comprehensive features for generating documentation with proper structure, content validation, and format checking.
