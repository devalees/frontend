# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Completed Test Implementation with passing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, including the refactoring phase. The implementation now follows a centralized approach where all test utilities are defined in a single file (testImplementationUtils.ts) that can be imported and used across all test files. This promotes consistency, reduces duplication, and makes maintenance easier. The tests follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach going through all three phases: Red (failing tests), Green (passing implementation), and Refactor (optimization while maintaining test coverage). All tests use the centralized testing utilities, properly mock the necessary functions, and maintain the minimum 90% coverage requirement. The implementation is now complete and ready for further feature development.
