# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Feature Setup**
   - [ ] Feature Configuration
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (featureConfig.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for feature setup
       - [ ] Write failing tests for feature validation
       - [ ] Write failing tests for feature integration
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Implement feature setup
       - [ ] Configure feature validation
       - [ ] Set up feature integration
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize configuration
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Feature Utilities
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (featureUtils.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for utility functions

   - [ ] Test Implementation
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (testImplementation.test.ts)
