# Feature Integration Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each feature task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Feature Setup**
   - [x] Feature Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (featureConfig.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature setup
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature validation
       - [x] Write failing tests for feature integration
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Implement feature setup
       - [x] Configure feature validation
       - [x] Set up feature integration

Last Updated: Completed Test Configuration implementation with solid test coverage (96.95% statements, 91.17% branches, 100% functions, 96.95% lines). The implementation provides robust configuration functionality for test setup, validation, and coverage reporting. All tests follow the test-driven development approach ensuring reliability and maintainability. Next steps will focus on Test Implementation.
