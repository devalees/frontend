# Global State Management Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each state management task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Implemented state hooks for managing component-level and global state interactions. Added a comprehensive debug mode that can be toggled in production environments, with action tracking, state history, and performance metrics. The debug mode is accessible through a UI panel, keyboard shortcuts, or URL parameters.
