# Global State Management Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each state management task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Completed refactoring of state management implementation with improved typing for middleware, slice factory pattern, extracted notification handling to separate slice, optimized history tracking to be selective about stored data, and simplified the store creation process. All required improvements have been implemented.
