# Global State Management Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each state management task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Store Setup**
   - [~] Zustand Configuration
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (zustandConfig.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for store creation
       - [x] Write failing tests for middleware
       - [x] Write failing tests for persistence
     - [~] Implementation
       - [x] Create base store
       - [x] Configure middleware
       - [x] Set up persistence
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize store setup
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [~] Middleware
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (middleware.test.ts)
       - [x] Write failing tests for logging

       - [x] Write failing tests for devtools
     - [~] Implementation
       - [x] Implement logging middleware
       - [x] Set up persistence middleware
       - [~] Configure devtools middleware
     - [ ] Refactoring

2. **State Management**
   - [x] State Slices
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (stateSlices.test.ts)

       - [x] Write failing tests for selectors
     - [x] Implementation
       - [x] Create state slices
       - [x] Implement actions
       - [x] Set up selectors
     - [x] Refactoring
       - [x] Optimize slices
       - [x] Update documentation
       - [x] Review and adjust

   - [s] Actions
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (actions.test.ts)

       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

3. **State Utilities**
   - [x] State Helpers
     - [x] Test Setup
       - [x] Create test file (stateHelpers.test.ts)

       - [ ] Review and adjust

Status Indicators:
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Completed
- [!] Blocked/Issues

Last Updated: Fixed the history middleware to correctly implement undo/redo functionality. Implemented state update and selector helpers with comprehensive test suites. Completed action effects implementation including notification, undo/redo, localStorage persistence, and logging effects. Added validation helpers to validate state data against schemas.
