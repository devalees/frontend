# Global State Management Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each state management task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Added TypeScript utility types to reduce code duplication in the state implementation. Created specialized types for async operations, selectors, computed values, pagination and more. Refactored existing slices to use these utility types, making the code more maintainable and type-safe.
