# Global State Management Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each state management task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Store Setup**
   - [ ] Zustand Configuration
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (zustandConfig.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for store creation
       - [ ] Write failing tests for middleware
       - [ ] Write failing tests for persistence
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Create base store
       - [ ] Configure middleware
       - [ ] Set up persistence
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize store setup
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Middleware
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (middleware.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for logging

       - [ ] Write failing tests for devtools
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Implement logging middleware
       - [ ] Set up persistence middleware
       - [ ] Configure devtools middleware
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize middleware
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

2. **State Management**
   - [ ] State Slices
     - [ ] Test Setup

       - [ ] Write failing tests for selectors
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Create state slices
       - [ ] Implement actions
       - [ ] Set up selectors
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize slices
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] Actions
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (actions.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for action creators

       - [ ] Write failing tests for action effects
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Create action creators

       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

3. **State Utilities**
   - [ ] State Helpers
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (stateHelpers.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for state updates
       - [ ] Write failing tests for state selectors

     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Create update helpers
       - [ ] Implement selector helpers

       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust

   - [ ] State Hooks
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (stateHooks.test.ts)
