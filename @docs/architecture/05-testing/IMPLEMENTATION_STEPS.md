# Testing Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each testing task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

1. **Test Setup**
   - [ ] Jest Configuration
     - [ ] Test Setup
       - [ ] Create test file (jestConfig.test.ts)
       - [ ] Write failing tests for configuration
       - [ ] Write failing tests for test environment
       - [ ] Write failing tests for test coverage
     - [ ] Implementation
       - [ ] Configure Jest
       - [ ] Set up test environment
       - [ ] Configure coverage
     - [ ] Refactoring
       - [ ] Optimize configuration
       - [ ] Update documentation
       - [ ] Review and adjust
