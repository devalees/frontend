# Testing Infrastructure Implementation Steps

## Test-Driven Development Approach
Each testing task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Last Updated: Implemented centralized testing utilities including custom render function, test fixtures, and API mocking utilities. All utilities are tested and documented with a comprehensive README. These utilities will standardize testing patterns across the codebase and reduce duplication in tests. The next steps are to complete the testing documentation and set up E2E testing.
