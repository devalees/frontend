# RBAC Resources Tests

This directory contains tests for the RBAC Resources management functionality, which is part of Phase 10 of the RBAC implementation plan.

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:

1. **Page Rendering**
   - Verifying that the resources page renders correctly with all components
   - Checking page title and resource list rendering
   - Validating breadcrumb navigation

2. **Form Interactions**
   - Opening and closing the resource form for creating new resources
   - Opening and closing the resource form for editing existing resources
   - Opening and closing the resource access management form

3. **CRUD Operations**
   - Resource creation process and success feedback
   - Resource update process and success feedback
   - Resource deletion with confirmation dialog
   - Resource access granting and management

4. **Error Handling**
   - Form validation errors
   - Server error responses

## Testing Approach

The tests follow the project's testing guidelines:

- Using centralized testing utilities from `src/tests/utils/`
- Using `componentTestUtils.ts` for React component tests
- No direct imports from testing libraries
- Following the existing project architecture
- Using Core Technologies stated in project rules

### Test Structure

1. **Mocking**
   - RBAC Hook: Mocks resource data and CRUD operations
   - Component Mocks: ResourceList, ResourceForm, ResourceAccessForm
   - UI Components: Card, Button, Toast, etc.

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Each test verifies a single aspect of functionality
   - React's `act()` is used to handle state updates properly
   - Assertions verify UI changes and user feedback (toasts)
   - Tests are isolated and don't affect each other

### Implementation Details

1. **Component Testing**
   - Uses `renderWithProviders` to render components with Zustand store
   - Verifies component interactions and DOM updates
   - Checks that forms open, close, and process data correctly

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verifies that components work together correctly
   - Tests data flow between components
   - Confirms user journey through the interface

3. **Handler Testing**
   - Validates event handlers and callbacks
   - Verifies UI state updates after actions
   - Ensures error handling works correctly

## Code Structure

The main test file `page.test.tsx` follows the React Testing Library approach:

1. **Arrange**: Set up component with test data
2. **Act**: Perform actions like clicks, form submissions
3. **Assert**: Verify the expected outcomes

## Running Tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test -- src/tests/app/rbac/resources
```

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage is high (above 90%) for the resources page, meeting the project requirement for test coverage.

## Future Improvements

Future test enhancements could include:

1. More detailed validation error testing
2. Testing for pagination and filtering in the resource list
3. Performance testing for large resource lists
4. Accessibility testing for forms and dialogs
