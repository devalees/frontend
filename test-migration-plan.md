# Test Migration Plan: Moving to Centralized Testing

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to migrate from the current disjointed testing approach to our centralized testing system. Instead of attempting to reach 90% coverage with the existing tests, we'll focus on properly migrating tests to the new system.

## Current State Analysis

- **Overall Coverage**: ~62% (statements/lines)
- **API Tests**: High coverage (~98%) with good quality
- **Component Tests**: Inconsistent coverage (0-99%)
- **Utility/Store Tests**: Variable coverage (0-96%)
- **Test Infrastructure**: A solid centralized testing system exists but isn't fully utilized

## Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (1-2 Weeks)

1. **Configure Coverage Reporting**
   - Create a separate coverage configuration that excludes unmigrated code
   - Set realistic thresholds based on current migrated code only
   - Add coverage reports to CI/CD to track progress

2. **Document Test Architecture**
   - Document the centralized testing system standards and patterns
   - Create templates for different test types (component, hook, util, etc.)
   - Establish testing guidelines for new code

3. **Stop Writing Tests in the Old Style**
   - All new tests must use the centralized system
   - Ensure all team members understand the new testing approach

### Phase 2: Core Module Migration (2-4 Weeks)

1. **Prioritized Migration List**
   - API Layer (already well-tested, needs minimal migration)
   - Core UI Components
   - Critical business logic utilities
   - State management core

2. **Migration Process for Each Module**
   - Create new test files in the centralized structure
   - Port existing test logic but improve with centralized utilities
   - Update coverage thresholds as modules are migrated
   - Document migration progress

### Phase 3: Systematic Migration (4-8 Weeks)

1. **Full Component Library**
   - Standardize component testing with the centralized system
   - Add missing tests for untested components
   - Port existing tests with improved structure

2. **Hooks and Utilities**
   - Migrate hook tests using centralized `renderHook`
   - Standardize utility tests with fixtures and helpers

3. **Store and State Management**
   - Use consistent patterns for testing state changes
   - Migrate action and reducer tests
   - Add tests for selectors

### Phase 4: Specialized Testing (8-12 Weeks)

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Define key user flows for integration testing
   - Use centralized integration test utilities

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add performance tests for critical paths
   - Integrate performance metrics into CI

3. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**
   - Add specialized tests for error states
   - Ensure boundary conditions are tested

## Coverage Goals

Instead of trying to reach 90% immediately, we'll set progressive targets:

1. **End of Phase 1**: Maintain current coverage but with better structure
2. **End of Phase 2**: 70% coverage of migrated modules
3. **End of Phase 3**: 80% coverage of all codebase
4. **End of Phase 4**: 90%+ coverage with high-quality tests

## Implementation Details

### Test File Structure

```
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── ComponentName/
  │   │   ├── ComponentName.tsx
  │   │   └── ComponentName.test.tsx  # Co-located tests
  │   └── ...
  ├── hooks/
  │   ├── useHookName.ts
  │   └── useHookName.test.ts  # Co-located tests
  └── tests/
      ├── utils/  # Centralized test utilities
      ├── fixtures/  # Test data
      ├── integration/  # Integration tests
      └── performance/  # Performance tests
```

### Migration Template

For each module to migrate:

1. **Analyze existing tests**
   - What functionality is being tested?
   - What's the current coverage?
   - What patterns are being used?

2. **Create new test file**
   - Use centralized utilities and patterns
   - Import fixtures from central location
   - Follow standard test organization

3. **Verify coverage**
   - Ensure the new tests cover at least what the old ones did
   - Add missing tests for uncovered features
   - Review edge cases

4. **Remove old tests**
   - Only after verifying new tests pass
   - Update imports if necessary

## Tracking Progress

We'll track migration progress with:

1. **Coverage Reports**: Regular coverage reports to show progress
2. **Migration Dashboard**: A simple dashboard showing what's been migrated
3. **Weekly Reviews**: Review migration progress in weekly meetings

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to gradually improve our test coverage while adopting better testing practices. Instead of patching the old system to artificially reach coverage targets, we're investing in a more maintainable and effective testing strategy.
